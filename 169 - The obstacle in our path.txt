169 - The obstacle in our path
##################################

In ancient times, a king had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.

Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the big stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along having a load of vegetables. On approaching the boulder, the peasant layed down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining he finally succeeded. 

As the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the king that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many others do not understand.

Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve one's condition.
