174 - Sweet Revenge
#########################

A king's soldiers caught a man whom they thought was a spy from the next kingdom. In his bag, they found some delicious looking sweets. The gredy solidiers wanted to eat the sweets. But to make sure that they were not poisoned, they made the man eat one first. Seeing that he was fine, the soliders gobbled up the sweets. 

On the way to the soldiers' headquarters, the stranger suddenly fell down, and began writhing and groaning in pain. Alarmed, the guards asked him what the matter was. He gasped out that perhaps, the sweets had been poisoned after all. The soldiers said, "But, nothing has happened to any of us!" Maybe its poison takes little time to work, he replied feebly. The next second, the frightened soldiers abandoned the man to rush off to a doctor. The spy calmly gathered his things and left.
