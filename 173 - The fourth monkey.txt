173 - The fourth monkey
#########################
I love gandhi's 3 monkeys (bura mat suno, bura mat dekho, bura mat kaho). 

So much that I got a person in Aligarh to caste them in brass as a gift with EKALAVYA written on the bottom. 

Once my old school teacher came to my house. When he was leaving I gifted him the brass 3 monkeys. He looked at them, appreciated them and said, "These three monkeys are okay. However, they will fail if the fourth monkey is not there."

I was surprised to hear his remark and sought clarification. He replied cryptically, "Oh, the fourth monkey is bura mat socho."

Thinking is the source of action and feeling. If I don't change my thinking, I can't change my actions and feelings.
