170 - Bad omen
##############

One day the king was on his way to the forest to hunt. So he ordered his guards to beat Nasrudin and send him away. However, the king had very good hunt and came back satisfied. 

Then he remembered about the Mulla and felt bad. So he asked that Nasrudin be brought to the castle.

Nasrudin walked in, bandaged and limping. "I am so sorry, Mulla," said the king. "I thought you were a bad omen for me. But I had a good hunt and realized that it's not true."

Nasrudin glared at the king. "And you thought I was a bad omen? Your highness, you saw me and had a successul hunt. I saw you and got beaten up. Who do you think is a bad omen?"
